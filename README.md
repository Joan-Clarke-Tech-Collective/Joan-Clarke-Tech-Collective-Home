  Clarke Collective
</h1>

<p>
  The Clarke Collective is dedicated to the advancement of human kindness and ingenuity
through techologies that enhance our capacity for empathy and make acts of liberation part of our daily lives.
</p>
<p>
  We believe that the human spirit inherently leans toward empathy, kindness, and freedom. We believe that by utilizing technology as a tool in those aims we can build a a better society for everyone.

  Our collective is named for English cryptographer and mathematician Joan Clarke. Alongside Alan Turing and others her mathemtical prowess helped defeat the Nazis. Despite her genius and heroism her contributions have remained obscured largely by misogyny in the STEM fields. Together with some of the greatest thinkers in the UK in her generation she revolutionized the fields of Computer Science and Mathematics and her contributions have found their way into the everyday lives of people across the world, often without even knowing it.  We seek to recognize the work she did through advancing the good technology can accomplish.
